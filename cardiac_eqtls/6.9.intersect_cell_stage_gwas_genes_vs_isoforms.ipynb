    "- MLST8: BMI, cholesterol; involved in mTOR pathway; A LOT of associations between mTOR and weight or cholesterol\n",
    "- **LPP**: blood pressure, gene involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. Mechanosensitive protein (PMC3642136). Involved in smooth muscle differentiation (16397143)\n",
    "- **KANK2**: pulse rate, gene involved in apoptosis by sequestering the proapoptotic factor AIFM1 in mitochondria. May play a role in MI by targeting NFKB (32570033)\n",
    "- ADAM15: blood pressure, migration and cell adhesion of smooth muscle cells\n",
    "- **NOD1**: LDL. NOD1 activation induces cardiac dysfunction and modulates cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Genetic inactivation of the innate immune receptor NOD1 prevents vascular inflammation linked to atherosclerosis (30496704)\n",
    "- ATXN2L: BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol; KO induces developmental delay and embryonic lethality in mice. No known function\n",
    "- NOMO3: heart rate, obesity; regulates NODAL (involved in embryonic development)\n",
    "- DKK3: heart rate; protects against cardiac dysfunction and ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction\n",

    "## other interesting genes:\n",
    "- PTPA: blood pressure. phosphatase that regulates myocyte function and may be associated with cardiac disease (PMC5939568)\n",
    "- **TRIOBP**: blood pressure and heart rate. Actin cytoskeleton organization. Different signals (primary and conditional) are associated with different traits.\n",
    "- **STAU1**: atheroclerosis, hypertension, cholesterol, blood pressure. Disease modifier in the neuromuscular disorder Myotonic Dystrophy Type I (DM1). Involved in splicing of insulin receptor\n",
    "- IP6K2: BMI, obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, blood pressure (only isoform: smooth muscle). involved in apoptosis and cell migration (PMC6383672). Treatment with inositols in obese PCOS patients is also effective in reducing BMI (PMC5766352)\n",
    "- SNHG1: blood pressure. The Long Non-Coding RNA SNHG1 Attenuates Cell Apoptosis by Regulating miR-195 and BCL2-Like Protein 2 in Human Cardiomyocytes\n",

       "11  ECG, heart rate The Bike Test consists of many phases. A phase is generally divided into number of stages. At various points during the test, called trends, readings about heart rate, workload etc are recorded.

       "12  This is the maximum heart rate recorded during bike exercise test. The Bike Test consists of three phases:   A Pre-Test phase, where a resting ECG is recorded for some time;   an Activity phase, where the participant cycles for a set period of time with increasing cycling workload;   and finally a Recovery phase, where the participant has stopped pedalling and an ECG is recorded.    Heart rate is recorded in all stages and this field gives the maximum of those values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
